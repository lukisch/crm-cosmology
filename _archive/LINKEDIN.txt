🔬 New Research Trilogy: Eliminating the Dark Sector with Game Theory & Geometry

I am excited to share a comprehensive new cosmological framework developed as an experiment in AI-Assisted Science. The "Curvature Feedback Model" (CFM) trilogy proposes a radical shift: what if 95% of the universe (Dark Energy + Dark Matter) is just geometry?

📄 Paper I (German): Replaces Dark Energy with a "Curvature Return Potential" derived from a cosmic Nash Equilibrium. Fits Pantheon+ supernovae significantly better than LambdaCDM.

📄 Paper II (English): Unifies CFM with MOND dynamics in a baryon-only universe. Hypothesis: "Dark Matter" is just the early, unsaturated phase of the same geometric process that becomes "Dark Energy" later.
Result: Delta Chi^2 = -26.3 vs Standard Model.

📄 Paper III (English): Microscopic foundations. Derives the Lagrangian and links the saturation mechanism to Quantum Gravity and Quantum Error Correction.

This work was co-written with Claude Opus and reviewed by Gemini, exploring the frontiers of human-AI collaboration in theoretical physics.
