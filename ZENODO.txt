dTitle: The Curvature Feedback Model Trilogy: From Game-Theoretic Cosmology to a Dark-Sector-Free Universe
Creators: Lukas Geiger
Description:
This deposit contains the "Curvature Feedback Model" (CFM) trilogy, a series of three working papers proposing a new cosmological framework that eliminates the need for a dark sector (Dark Energy and Dark Matter).

Paper I: Spieltheoretische Kosmologie und das Krümmungs-Rückgabepotential-Modell (German)
- Establishes the game-theoretic foundation: Spacetime as a Nash equilibrium between a null space and a spacetime bubble.
- Proposes the CFM to explain accelerated expansion via a geometric saturation mechanism (tanh-potential) rather than Lambda.
- Validated against Pantheon+ Supernovae (Delta Chi^2 = -12.2 vs LambdaCDM).

Paper II: Eliminating the Dark Sector: Unifying the Curvature Feedback Model with MOND (English)
- Extends the model to a baryon-only universe (Omega_m = 0.05).
- Introduces the "Decaying Dark Geometry" hypothesis: Dark Matter is an early-time geometric phase (scaling as a^-2), Dark Energy is the late-time saturated phase.
- Achievements: Delta Chi^2 = -26.3 vs LambdaCDM on Pantheon+ data.

Paper III: Microscopic Foundations of the Curvature Feedback Model (English)
- Derives the Lagrangian formulation (R + R^2 + Pöschl-Teller scalar).
- Explores connections to Quantum Gravity (LQG, Finsler Geometry, Quantum Error Correction).
- Proposes distinctive observational tests (Cosmic Birefringence, Gravitational Slip).

Methodology: These papers represent an experiment in AI-Assisted Science, with explicit disclosure of AI roles (Claude Opus 4.6 as Co-Writer, Gemini as Reviewer).

Keywords: Cosmology, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, MOND, Game Theory, Quantum Gravity, Curvature Feedback Model, Pantheon+, AI-Assisted Science
