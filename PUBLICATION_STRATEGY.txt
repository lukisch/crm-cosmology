PUBLICATION STRATEGY
====================

PHASE 1: PREPRINT & ARCHIVAL
1. Finalize PDF compilation of all three papers.
2. Deposit the full trilogy on Zenodo as a single record (ensure permanent DOI).
3. Update ResearchGate with the "Working Paper" versions.

PHASE 2: COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT
1. Publish the LinkedIn announcement pointing to the Zenodo DOI.
2. Share the GitHub repository (https://github.com/lukisch/cfm-cosmology) containing the analysis code (Python/MCMC).
3. Contact key researchers mentioned in the papers (e.g., Scolnic, Skordis, Komatsu) for informal feedback.

PHASE 3: PEER REVIEW
1. Target Journal: Consider "Classical and Quantum Gravity" or "Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics" (JCAP).
2. Strategy: Submit Paper II (The Unified Model) first, as it has the strongest empirical result (Delta Chi^2 = -26.3). Attach Paper I and III as supplementary material or submit as a series if the journal allows.

AI DISCLOSURE NOTE:
Ensure the "AI Disclosure and Methodology" section remains prominent in all submissions to set a standard for transparency in AI-assisted research.
